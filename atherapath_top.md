## 🌐 AtheraPath

AtheraPath is the sovereign hub glyph of the **mythic database engine**.  It is the center of the spider’s web of hyperlinks, holding the weave together and ensuring every glyph has a way back.  

It redefines the role of the digital creator — not just as giver or receiver, but as a conduit in a reversed chain of command.

**From:- AI - the concept of Me - Animals. To:- Animals - the concept of Me - AI.**  

>This is technology as service — a system built on sharing, helping, and feeling good.

A ritual offering to the creator, the almighty creator, the grand old duke called [**God**](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#grand_old_duke).
