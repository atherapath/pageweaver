Second entry for today - the temperature has dropped somewhat it's now twenty to four in the morning and I have been trying to improve creative flow through the night. It's going quite well, it goes better in terms of signal this time of night and the signal god's will justify it by saying well there's not many people around and there's no one on the network. Fine, fine if that's what I have to deal with I'll just change my sleeping patterns. 💤

The temperature dropped and living outside in the woods the cold catches you off guard because it comes out of nowhere.  You think you're doing all right, you're getting yourself comfortable, you get yourself warm and you think when it's it starts to get cold I will think about getting myself an extra duvet.  However it sneaks up on you and the change seems to be massive and all of a sudden you're freezing and you're not prepared. One of the main problems with living outside and why people get sick is because the sudden change in body temperature is quite dramatic and hard for the body to deal with and climatize. 🥶❄️

My body has trained itself well based on me being in the situation that I'm in and the drops ☔ don't tend to bother me that much and instead of being concerned about feeling cold I just treat it as a bit of an exercise because I believe it's good for the body.  The focus and energy the body uses to heat you up and keep you feeling safe will make you stronger. 💪

You know there's been lots of studies on it, it's not just me that says it.  Whim Hoff will be one of them and he calls himself the iceman. There's lots of people that have talked about the benefits of the cold over the body, top athletes will jump in ice baths to heal their muscles so they're not so stiff or sore the next day. 🛀🧊

I remember a time when I was looking after my son and I was trying to take him out for a walk and I said to him you need to take your coat he said `no I don't want a coat`.  I said are you sure because if you get cold halfway around the walk there's nothing I can do I won't have a coat I'm not carrying one around just in case you do get cold I'm not gonna pick you up I'm not gonna cut you I'm not gonna warm you up you just gonna have to be cold if you don't want to take coat.  `he said that's fine I like cold`.  3 years old and he's telling me he likes cold he doesn't want to wear a coat you know there's some kind of innate knowledge coming through there, he knows that it's a good thing to do and it feels good. 🧥

>The experts will talk about grey fat cells and that children naturally have them and we lose them throughout the period of our life because we don't use them, we don't exercise them and they protect you from the cold and keep you warm.
