## i forgot what I was fighting to get here for...
This point in time I feel like I'm in complete creative flow, able to speak my voice have it dictated to me and format it on the fly by touching my phone on a few occasions.

Any kind of think to yourself what do I talk about now I'm finally in this situation.  I finally got here I have a workflow that is airtight and my voice is going to be represented in the way I want and dictated in the way I want.

## oh yeah things that don't make sense...
And there's a big subject that I want to try and cover it's the control of society with rules about what someone can and can't put in their mouth. 👄

In my opinion, if someone is putting something in their mouth and it makes them feel happy oh good and it's not harming anyone else it's just helping them to feel good, what's the problem, what they're doing wrong? 🌬️🚭

## the power of mother nature
I myself I'm always looking for the perfect mummy, you know the one that is going to meet all my needs.  Give me everything I need and want and be proud of me.  Sometimes I'm also looking for the perfect child, a little bowl of expectation hoping along with me that it will meet my expectation in fact I may even call it hope. I tell you what to expect when You're expecting is a little ball of expectations that will not meet your expectations it doesn't matter if you call them hope which is just another word for expectation.

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have these combined together, the perfect mummy and the perfect child.  Fuse together to be the perfect feminine figure in vaginal form to give me everything I need in one and be proud of me while meeting all my expectation the perfect mummy and the perfect child in one.👨‍🍳👨‍🌾👨‍✈️

## oooooh that feels good
And in the absence of that and the feeling I get from that, the feeling of security and the feeling of being helped.  A sense of safety in my body, I can sort of generate (what I imagine that feels like) because I haven't had a lot of it - with a ***joint*** as they call it from a feminine ☘️

It's the feminine plant that makes you feel good, that's what they call THC and it's the masculine plant the makes you feel a little bit good that's what they call CBD or hemp. 🌱🌿

Now as I understand it I can walk in to a ridiculous amount of what they now call vape shops, in my day they called them head shops. They serve all kinds of things like bongs, kingskins, grinders, and little storage devices specifically so you can store it all in a little box and what's it all for, what can you put in it? 🎁

## it's CBD not THC honest CID
I tell you what you can put it in CBD.  The stuff that smells exactly the same, looks exactly the same, tastes exactly the same however it doesn't feel as good in fact eventually it will make you feel like s***.

So that's what I put in it you know, I don't have a choice the law tells me, that's what I have to put in it so that's what I put in it.  Now if you want to go and get yourself a tiny tiny little needle and a tiny tiny little microscope and test whether you can see THC or CBD that's fine by me and I'm going to get on with my day.

## the rec categorisation of plants
You know hemp which is a similar plant to what we now call weed (it's not a weed).  In fact the closer categorization to a weed would be a rapeseed plant ☘️ like a weed you know, like a seed that has been raped by glue to be made to look like an oil so you can eat it constantly, it's in everything even a little pot of olives which are supposed to generate their own olive oil.  And then when it comes out the other end, your bottom will feel like it's been raped by a seed has been raped by glue to be made to look an oil. Oils change with temperature, coconut oil changes with the temperature, rapeseed oil doesn't. And lastly (not quite) on this subject it's not a vegetable oil there's nothing vegetable about it.🍅

## brexit you say....
And this seemed to happen overnight - overnight rapeseed oil just appeared in everything. Coconut oil was one of the only things you could buy off the shelf which was still in its raw form and you could do everything with it.  

- Clean your hair 
- clean your teeth 
- moisturize your skin 
- heal your skin 

...and now it's gone from everywhere. Well they tell you it's coconut, not coconut darling, look at the back, what's the main ingredient oh aqua. 💦🚰

Is seems overnight after the whole brexit thing, coconut oil disappeared from the shelves.  You can now only get it in Sainsbury's and rapeseed oil has been put in everything, even bread, even cakes, even pots of olives, even chocolate.🍫🍪

## yes I can....
The average pub goes through about 20 litres a fortnight just using it to cook the food they serve you, it's in everything, Chinese, Indian, Cantonese, you pick, choose your food they are all using gallons of rapeseed oil.  In my experience doesn't make me feel good, gives me heartburn, gas, is hard to digest and it hurts on the way out.  Do I need to get that peer reviewed to say I have an allergy? 

>Can I make my own mind up as to what I'm allergic to and what I don't want to put in my body .......yes I can.
