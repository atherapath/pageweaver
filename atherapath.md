## 🔁 How It Flows

1. A Glyph Is Born — a simple Markdown file paired with an image (and sometimes a video).  
2. It Takes Shape — through Page-Weaver, rendered into a page alive with motion and meaning.  
3. It Connects — hyperlinks branch out, pulling readers into other glyphs, and thus the Path grows.  

There is no algorithm deciding who should see what — only the gravity of curiosity and the pull of shared imagination.

### Reflection  
this hub now links to the sovereign date‑slug chain.  
earlier glyphs are inscribed as **previous works** — sovereign under their own law,  
but connected here for continuity and witness.
