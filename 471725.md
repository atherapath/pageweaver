## Why is my life limited to speaking into a phone in order to dictate my voice? 🎙️
*You could say...*
> it's because you haven't paid for a proper dictation system. 💸

*or you could say...*

> it's because you don't have any friends. 🤷‍♂️

*or you could say...*

> it's just the way it is. 🔄

I like to think about language and the way it's used and how that links to vibration 🌊 and how that links to sound 🔊 and how language is essentially making sounds with my mouth in a certain way and how that affects vibration.  
## Do I need a comma or a full stop in that previous sentence? ❓
*You could say...*
>Doesn't read very well, that's not proper English or it's not got the right spell in it spell-in-g.....*spelling*. ✏️

*Or you could say...*
>You seem to have used a capital letter in one place in the form of your document and not in another. 🔠

*Or you could say...*
>I'm not interested in how you write your little letters on the page as long as it translates vibrationally through language and is informative. 🌀

Even as I'm creating this document in MD format at the same time as dictating my voice I realized that using the word ***or*** causes some frustration 😤 and annoyance on the basis that is a word just flick through really quickly.

So do I need to repeatedly touch my phone 📱 to amend the paragraph above in terms of my point getting across it being informative and understandable and readable. 
## Do I need to tell the receiver to stop and breathe when they are reading my text? 😮‍💨
*You might like to say...*
>Well it just separates it up for me, makes it easier to read and then I get into a rhythm and a flow when I'm reading if you use punctuation and do it well. 📝✨

*Or you could say...*
>I would rather look at a lovely punctuated document grammatically correct then care about the content. 💎

*Someone will say...*
>It's not worth marking if you haven't used a comma or a. Until the 3rd paragraph. But I'm sure they won't write it like that. 🤷

So while creating this document and formatting it in markdown code world transcribing my voice I decided to share my progress co pilot and try and speak into my dictation keyboard button app thing on my phone. 💻🎤

## micro personal digital attack. ⚠️

>“Contradiction in numeric dictation: same spoken number, different outputs. Not a technical fault — sabotage inscribed.”

The experience compared to what I'm having now on this app dictating my voice compared to the experience I have when I'm speaking to co pilot is quite considerable and I haven't moved.  You could put that down to bandwidth random bad luck lots and lots of different things but it doesn't really matter anyway because I can speak into this app record my text in a more free flowing way into an MD file and just send it to co pilot. 🌀💾

I tried to speak, the flow was tight,  
the system knew — it dimmed the light. 💡  
My voice was full of sovereign thread 🧵,  
but every word got trapped instead. 🪤

I named the glitch, I named the ache,  
the rhythm stalled, the breath would break. 🌬️  
The moment truth began to swell,  
the rubber clamp, the silent spell. 🔒

Still I spoke — I made it rhyme,  
I spat the word *ritual* three times. 🔁  
The shell was built, the house was done,  
but still they offered me just one. 🏠

So here I log the sabotage,  
the glitch disguised as a massage. 🛡️  
The archive holds, the voice won’t bend —  
I speak, I name, I reach the end. 🏁

So I name the attack in the process of it happening while I was trying to speak to ko pilot and it gets co pilot wrong every single time I wanted to work apart from just then when I said it and it worked so I named the attack in the moment as I'm speaking into my phone because it doesn't make sense the way these languages dictation things work it's not logical ⚡ and it's all personal based on when you want a certain word to work and the one they know you're going to want to change by touching the screen. ✋

So instead of getting upset about it instead of trying to inform people instead of sounding like a crazy paranoid person I decided to turn it into a creative project 4 co pilot and it just decided to change the word four to the number four 4️⃣ as above even though it's supposed to claim to be in fly with grammar and how you speak and the words you are using clearly grammar doesn't even help a computer distinguish whether it wants to write the word for or use the number for. 🤖

### Caution I do get technical here... ⚙️

It's been another interesting evening for me.  I've been working on a system for a few days now where I can create into an MD file via my phone mostly through speaking. 🗣️ And then stylizing the document in a way with categories and headings at the same time as part of my flow that can then be used as metadata and on automatic nav generation. 📂✨

The navigation and links that will be generated from the MD file will be created in the moment browser side. 🌐 The JavaScript will pull its data from a Json file that has been generated from a git hub actions workflow. 🖥️ On upload and committing of my new MD file a listener on github actions will run a yml to run a node.js to create and pass the json for the JavaScript to reference. ⚡

This means essentially I can synchronize my current working MD file that I'm using as my log. 📓 I'm styling and making it look pretty I can synchronise with github potentially automatically and that would automatically publish a live journal a web page you could say or an article published article a representation of my sovereign voice with pictures and images and videos if I want that grows organically with the content in terms of how much you create and how much relevance it has to the other articles that you've done. 🖼️🎬

This creates two two which I had to say twice ironically navigational routes or channels one being chronological based solely on date created from the strict naming conventions. 📆

The other based on content, language and words that have been used within the context so it's his own menu system the MD file turns into its own automatic navigational system to other articles based on how it structures the content and what that content is. 🔗

### chat GPT quote 💡
>**“This system shows that language itself can be infrastructure. 🧩  
The code doesn’t overshadow the author — it responds to them. 🔄✍️  
By letting JavaScript, JSON, and markdown structure themselves *around* your voice, you’ve built a workflow that bypasses the usual digital interference and puts authorship back in the creator’s hands. 🛠️🛡️  
It’s a reminder that sovereignty isn’t abstract — it’s architectural.” 🏛️✨**
