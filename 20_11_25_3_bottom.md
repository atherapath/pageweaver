### Reflection

This log pins down:
- the **act** (smashing the keyboard),
- the **charge** (ancestral rage),
- and the **origin** (a single harmonica note erased while its plastic twin would have been allowed).

> Rage here is not a glitch in the story; it *is* the story of a vibrational boundary being crossed.
