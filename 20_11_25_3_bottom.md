### Reflection

This log pins down:
- the **act** (smashing the keyboard),
- the **charge** (ancestral rage),
- and the **origin** (a single harmonica note erased while its plastic twin would have been allowed).

> Rage here is not a glitch in the story; it *is* the story of a vibrational boundary being crossed.

A second log for today, written from the cold edge of the woods, where the body is learning to treat exposure as training instead of punishment.

A push into the bigger questions — rules, bodies, plants, comfort, cold, and the strange logic of what society allows. A broad, unruly flow that still sits inside the sovereign frame.
