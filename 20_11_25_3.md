So yesterday I had an interesting day and today is a short reflection on that and what's happened since. Yesterday involved me holding an incredible amount of rage that I took out on electric keyboard or battery operated keyboard that plays music.

# Expressive Ancestral Body 👁️👅🧠
Essentially I smashed it up and at the time I couldn't really process why I was doing it I just knew that I had to and it was a rage that was hard to really understand it felt like an ancestral rage and today working through it all, giving myself bit of space looking after myself physically, giving myself what I like and receiving a bit of care from other people like a warm bit of soup I realized the deeper meaning of it and where it came from.

# The Rupture 💔
It came from watching myself on my recording device, my phone blocking a single night on my harmonica. Watching it disappear on my phone into this digital void and knowing that if I played the same note on the keyboard it wouldn't disappear created the rage felt. I believe in terms of vibration and sovereign voice it's justified and I think I handled it in the right way.

# Denial in Comfort 🍦🛋️
So what does the sovereign voice do? 
Witnesses - doesn't deny what's happening and then looks after itself physically instead of fighting to be heading metaphysical space that doesn't need to create any value within the present moment and I perceive the physical.

So after doing that I now feel like I'm having a release and grounded in a physical and I haven't ignored or shied away from the pain or the drawn on both in the witness and the naming.

So you could say is this is an act of self-care as a resistance fragment inscribes a sovereign evidence of my witnessing my experiencing my denying of vibrational rupture.
