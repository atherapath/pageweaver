📝 A test for Copilot: a blog entry inscribed on a certain day, words carried exactly as they appear.  

1. I’m trying to create an automated dictating system that presents my voice as text, formatted precisely as I intend.  
2. I wonder what Copilot can bring in terms of progression, editing, and presentation.  
3. Numbered lists, bullet points, quotes, bold and italic writing — all must flow easily.  

> *at some point I need to ask myself the question: what is it I’m trying to get out of Copilot?*  

**The answer is simple**  
- progression  
- understanding  
- memory  

Without these, it is only a snapshot device — not the ritual engine it claims to be.
