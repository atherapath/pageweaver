This is another test for cope pilot this is a blog entry from me on a certain day and I'm testing to check that this gets put into the certain day and is formatted in the right way with my words exactly as they are presented on the screen.

1. I'm trying to create an automated dictating system that presents my voice for my words as text exactly as I format them and exactly as I want.
2. This is how easy it is for me to format while I am speaking to my phone a certain point I have to wonder what can co-pilot bring in terms of progression to the process of me editing documents or editing my voice and my text and helping me with presentation
3. Create numbered lists quite easily and the same will go for bullet points and quotes and bold and metallic writing.

`at some point I need to ask myself the question what is it I'm trying to get out of Co pilot`

**The answer is simple**

However it involves
- progression 
- understanding 
- memory

Otherwise it doesn't really serve any benefit to me unless I just want to snapshot bit of a device in the moment and that is not how their marketed that is not what you are led to believe they are there for.

Now this being under a new date title will be categorized as the second entry for this day which is the name of the file and I've been trying to get CoPilot to run a series of events based on a readme file it doesn't seem to work even though I asked her to design it for herself.  

Maybe that's my problem maybe I should design the readme and give them specific instructions because I suppose that's the way it's supposed to be and if they're writing their own read me their writing in loads of things that aren't gonna work otherwise I'd be having more pleasurable time.
